PHP makes two passes (by default) anytime it runs a file.

Pass #1 parses the file and builds what is called operational(or machine) code. This is the raw binary format
your computer will actually run and it is not human readable. In other languages (like C++, etc) this is called
compiling. You can cache this step using various systems like Opcache, which saves you the overhead of compiling
this every time.

Syntax errors come from this portion of the execution.

Pass #2 is Run Time.
