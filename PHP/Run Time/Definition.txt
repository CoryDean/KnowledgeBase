PHP makes two passes (by default) anytime it runs a file.

Pass #1 is Compile Time.

Pass #2 executes the operational code from Pass #1. This is what is commonly called "run time", because your
computer is actually executing the instructions.

Run-time errors (like exhausting memory, abnormal termination, etc) come from this level. These are considerably
less common than syntax errors, however.
